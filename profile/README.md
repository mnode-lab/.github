# 🚀 µnode-lab (Micro-Node Lab)

We are a small collective of tech enthusiasts from diverse engineering backgrounds, driven by curiosity and the spirit of open-source validation.

## 🔬 The Mission
After diving deep into the [DeepSeek-V3 paper](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3), we were captivated by its transparent breakdown of inference costs and systematic optimizations. 

While the paper has been out for a year, its structural analysis of "cost-per-token" remains a gold standard for engineering benchmarks. It sparked a simple yet challenging question for us:

> **If we re-calculate and re-implement these benchmarks using today’s consumer-grade hardware, how far can we actually push the performance?**

## 🛠️ Our Principles
* **Pure Validation:** This is a pure engineering experiment dedicated to technical truth.
* **Not a Startup:** We have no pitch decks, no funding plans, and no commercial roadmap.
* **Total Transparency:** Everything we do—from scripts to environment logs—is open-source.
* **Honest Documentation:** We might succeed, or we might fail. Either way, every step, bottleneck, and "aha!" moment will be documented right here.

## 📅 Public Progress (Build in Public)
- **2026-01-06**: Established the organization profile and defined the core mission.
- **Ongoing**: Benchmarking consumer-grade hardware clusters.
